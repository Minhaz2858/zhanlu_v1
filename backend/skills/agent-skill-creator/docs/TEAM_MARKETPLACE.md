# Governed Team Skill Marketplace — Complete Timeline

Use this page from top to bottom. It contains every command needed to create an
ACME marketplace, admit individual skills, release approved bundles, install them
in VS Code Copilot Agent Mode, and update or roll them back.

## Choose the Git provider first

| ACME environment | Use |
|---|---|
| GitHub plus VS Code Copilot Agent Mode | Use the default `github` backend below. |
| GitLab.com | Add `--provider gitlab`; use the [GitLab command timeline](GITLAB_TEAM_REGISTRY.md). |
| Self-managed GitLab | Add `--provider gitlab --host <hostname>`; nested groups are supported. |

Both backends use the same schema-v2 bundles, quality gates, catalog, approval
evidence, CODEOWNERS, and immutable version pins. GitHub generates Actions and uses
`gh skill`; GitLab generates `.gitlab-ci.yml`, releases with `glab`, and installs
from a shallow clone at the exact tag.

## Governance begins before generation

Marketplace governance starts with a resumable `interview.json`, not when a completed
skill is submitted. The agent inspects workflow evidence, records its conclusions as
`proposed`, and preserves supported disagreements as `conflicting`. An identified
human owner must confirm consequential meaning and risk before the interview becomes
`READY`; missing evidence or authority leaves it `BLOCKED` and resumable.

Only a `READY` interview permits skill generation. The generated skill preserves that
file as its evidence-and-authority trail, and marketplace validation rejects a present
but unresolved interview. The marketplace operator reviews the authorized contract
and its implementation; the operator does not silently supply missing business
authority. See the [structured interview protocol](../references/structured-interview.md).

## Roles and handoffs

This marketplace has two distinct users. Do not send the command-line sections below
to a subject-matter expert unless they are also the marketplace operator.

| Role | Does | Does not do | Handoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workflow expert / SME** | Describes the work in plain language; supplies real artifacts; confirms business meaning, risk, and a representative result | Use Git, edit the registry, run marketplace CLI commands, select release tags, or manage endpoint policy | “This skill is correct; publish it to `<department>`.” |
| **Marketplace operator / platform team** | Runs admission, governance, release, deployment, update, quarantine, and rollback | Invent missing business authority or approve unresolved meanings for the SME | Publishes a governed, exact version for users to install |
| **Skill consumer** | Installs or receives the approved skill and uses it in their agent | Edit an installed copy or bypass its pinned release | Reports corrections to the SME/owner |

The SME's starting prompt can be as small as:

```text
Turn my monthly revenue-variance review into a reusable internal skill.
I attached the past reports and source spreadsheets. The decision is whether to
escalate a material variance. It must not modify source data.
```

The skill factory turns that evidence into a tested artifact. Only after the SME
approves the representative result does the operator begin the command-line workflow
in Phase A and beyond.

## What each component does

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `agent-skill-creator` | Creates and verifies one individual skill from workflow evidence. |
| Governed Git repository | Catalogs skills by department, runs gates, records approval, and builds bundles. |
| Provider backend | Uses `gh skill` on GitHub or tagged Git clone and copy on GitLab. |
| ACME device management | Runs the managed install command on approved endpoints. |

Plugins are a secondary compatibility channel for supported CLI hosts. For VS Code
Copilot Agent Mode, use the provider's pinned bundle install operation.

## Phase A — One-time platform setup

### A1. Confirm prerequisites

Run these commands on the platform developer's machine:

```bash
python3 --version
gh --version
gh auth status
gh skill --help
```

Required state:

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Authenticated GitHub CLI 2.90 or newer.
- `gh skill` available. It remains a public-preview command.
- Permission to create and protect the target GitHub repository.

### A2. Initialize the marketplace

Run from the `agent-skill-creator` repository:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py init \
  --name "ACME Skills" \
  --repository ACME/acme-skills \
  --department finance=finance-owner \
  --department operations=operations-owner \
  --approver acme-platform \
  --approver acme-security \
  --supported-platform github-copilot \
  --starter-bundle analyst-starter \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Repeat `--department SLUG=OWNER`, `--approver`, `--supported-platform`, and
`--starter-bundle` as needed. The generated registry, `CODEOWNERS`, governance policy,
and empty bundle manifests carry these declarations; no manual registry edit is
required.

This creates:

```text
acme-skills/
├── skills/<department>/<skill>/
├── bundles/
├── scripts/team_marketplace.py
├── registry.json
├── CATALOG.md
├── CODEOWNERS
├── GOVERNANCE.md
└── .github/workflows/
```

To migrate an existing schema-v1 registry, initialize with one additional option:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py init \
  --name "ACME Skills" \
  --repository ACME/acme-skills \
  --from-registry ./legacy-registry \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Migration never grants approval. Migrated skills remain `draft` until their source,
owners, scripts, and quality evidence are reviewed.

A starter bundle created with `--starter-bundle` may be empty before the first
admission. Its generated manifest is:

```json
{
  "name": "analyst-starter",
  "skills": []
}
```

Do not add a placeholder or nonexistent skill to populate it.

### A3. Put the scaffold in GitHub

```bash
cd ./acme-skills
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: initialize governed ACME skill marketplace"
gh repo create ACME/acme-skills --private --source=. --push
```

Do not add individual skills before the repository governance is configured.

### A4. Protect releases and reviews

Open `GOVERNANCE.md` in the generated repository. Configure the GitHub default
branch ruleset to require:

- Pull requests and CODEOWNER review.
- The `governed-marketplace` status check.
- Department-owner plus platform/security approval.
- No force pushes or branch deletion.

Configure a tag ruleset for `v*.*.*` that restricts tag creation, updates, and
deletion to release administrators. GitHub settings are required here; there is no
local command that can prove the organization applied its rulesets correctly.

## Phase B — Repeat for each individual skill

### B1. Create and verify one skill

In an installed agent environment, provide the real workflow evidence:

```text
/agent-skill-creator Create a skill from the attached ACME monthly reporting workflow.
```

Every skill is checked as one connected system. The skill graph links its
instructions, scripts, evaluations, and expected outputs. Two structural
requirements confirm that every expected result is tested and every predictable
multi-step workflow has one reliable entry point. Four checks—specification,
pipeline, security, and evaluation schema—run in parallel. Finally, a representative
run proves that the skill produces a useful result.

A skill is ready for marketplace intake only after both structural requirements, all
four checks, and the representative run pass.

Before `add`, its `SKILL.md` metadata must include real values:

```yaml
metadata:
  author: ACME Finance
  version: 1.2.0
  approval_status: approved
  owners: [acme-finance-skills]
```

Do not declare `allowed-tools: shell` or `allowed-tools: bash`. Copilot must request
runtime permission when a reviewed script actually needs execution.

### B2. Add the skill to a department and bundle

Run from the `agent-skill-creator` repository, pointing at the marketplace clone:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py add ./report-skill \
  --department finance \
  --bundle analyst-starter \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

`add` runs the gates before copying. A failure stops intake. A successful add writes
the skill to `skills/finance/report-skill/`, updates `registry.json`, regenerates the
bundle manifest and catalog, and updates CODEOWNERS.

### B3. Run the repository check

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py check \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The check refuses draft skills, failed gates, duplicate identities, missing owners,
unsafe tool pre-approval, path traversal, inconsistent metadata, and broken bundle
manifests.

### B4. Submit the governed change

```bash
cd ./acme-skills
git switch -c feat/add-finance-report-skill
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add ACME finance report skill"
git push -u origin feat/add-finance-report-skill
gh pr create --fill
```

Department, platform, and security owners review the pull request. Merge only after
the generated GitHub Actions checks and required reviews pass.

## Phase C — Release and deliver approved bundles

### C1. Release an immutable version

Before the release pull request merges, record the reviewed release authorization:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py lifecycle report-skill \
  --department finance --to published --marketplace .
```

Commit that generated registry and catalog change through the normal review path.
After the pull request reaches the protected default branch:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py release \
  --tag v1.2.0 \
  --marketplace .
```

`release` reruns marketplace checks, requires a semantic-version tag, and calls
`gh skill publish`. Do not reuse or move an existing release tag.

### C2. Install the approved bundle

User scope makes the bundle available across the analyst's projects:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py install \
  --bundle analyst-starter \
  --scope user \
  --pin v1.2.0 \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Project scope installs it only for the current repository:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py install \
  --bundle analyst-starter \
  --scope project \
  --pin v1.2.0 \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Install one discovered skill without pulling its whole bundle:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py install \
  --skill report-skill \
  --department finance \
  --scope project \
  --pin v1.2.0 \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Single-skill installs use the same lifecycle checks, immutable version pinning,
provider adapter, and privacy-safe install event as bundle installs.

The wrapper issues one exact command per bundled skill:

```bash
gh skill install ACME/acme-skills skills/finance/report-skill \
  --agent github-copilot \
  --scope user \
  --pin v1.2.0
```

The marketplace controls what may be installed. ACME endpoint management controls
how that command reaches 200 managed devices.

### C3. Update or roll back

Update by explicitly installing a newer approved release:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py install \
  --bundle analyst-starter \
  --scope user \
  --pin v1.3.0 \
  --force \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Roll back by reinstalling the last known-good tag:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py install \
  --bundle analyst-starter \
  --scope user \
  --pin v1.2.0 \
  --force \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

There is no moving “latest” channel in the governed workflow. Every managed change
names the exact release that should be present.

For a local provider test, clone or check out the exact immutable tag into a temporary
source directory, then run the project-scoped install from the clean consumer project.
Installing from the marketplace's mutable working tree does not prove release or
rollback behavior.

```bash
git -C /tmp/acme-skills checkout --detach v1.2.0
cd /tmp/clean-consumer-project
python3 /tmp/acme-skills/scripts/team_marketplace.py install \
  --bundle analyst-starter \
  --scope project \
  --local \
  --pin v1.2.0 \
  --marketplace /tmp/acme-skills
```

With `--local --pin`, the CLI verifies that marketplace `HEAD` is the exact requested
tag before invoking the provider's local transport. It does not pass an incompatible
pin argument through to `gh skill --from-local`.

### C4. Correct a skill through the repository

Never edit an installed copy. Capture the correction in the skill source:

```bash
python3 ./report-skill/scripts/evolve.py \
  --correct "ACME UK revenue closes one business day later"
```

Commit and attest the corrected source, then update the existing marketplace entry:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py update ./report-skill \
  --department finance --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

`update` requires a strictly newer semantic version and reruns validation, security,
pipeline, eval, clean-commit, and representative-run attestation gates before it
replaces any files. It preserves bundle membership, resets lifecycle to `approved`,
and clears compatibility certification because evidence from an older version cannot
certify the new payload. Open a pull request, obtain approval, re-certify supported
platforms, transition to `published`, release a new semantic-version tag, and install
the new pin.

## Command map

| When | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Once | `team_marketplace.py init` | Creates the governed repository scaffold. |
| Every intake | `team_marketplace.py add` | Gates and copies one skill into a department and bundle. |
| Every new version | `team_marketplace.py update` | Re-gates a strictly newer version and preserves its bundles. |
| Before PR/release | `team_marketplace.py check` | Verifies the complete marketplace state. |
| After approved merge | `team_marketplace.py release --tag vX.Y.Z` | Publishes an immutable approved release. |
| Deployment/update/rollback | `team_marketplace.py install --pin vX.Y.Z` | Installs exact bundled skills for Copilot. |

## Trust evidence and lifecycle

Marketplace intake now requires executable evals and a representative-run
attestation bound to the exact, clean Git commit being submitted. After committing
the skill, create the evidence:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py attest ./report-skill \
  --run-id representative-2026-08-25 \
  --completed-at 2026-08-25T15:00:00Z
```

The skill lifecycle is `draft → in-review → approved → published`. Incident and
retirement paths add `quarantined`, `deprecated`, and `retired`. Only an authorized
transition is accepted:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py lifecycle report-skill \
  --department finance --to quarantined --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Quarantined, deprecated, and retired skills cannot be installed. The
`approved → published` transition is committed before release so GitHub and GitLab
publish the exact reviewed registry state.

When repair would preserve the wrong assumptions, retire and recreate the skill as a
new generation. Recreation resets the skill version to `1.0.0`, assigns a fresh
lineage identity, records the reset reason and predecessor, and does not inherit
attestations, eval baselines, compatibility certifications, or success metrics. It
preserves governed history; erasing sensitive material from Git history, tags,
releases, caches, and artifacts is a separate privileged purge procedure.

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py recreate ./replacement-skill \
  --department finance \
  --reason "The original decision model is no longer valid" \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The existing identity must already be `retired`, and the replacement source version
must be exactly `1.0.0`. `recreate` reruns every fresh admission and attestation gate,
preserves bundle membership, creates an approved next generation with a new
`lineage_id`, clears certifications, and retains a predecessor/reason tombstone.

## Blind cross-team acceptance

Technical checks do not prove that another department can operate the marketplace.
Run the [blind organizational acceptance protocol](ORGANIZATIONAL_ACCEPTANCE.md) with
isolated administrator, workflow-expert, operator, and consumer sessions. The exact
gate is create, publish, discover, install, invoke twice, update, rollback,
quarantine, blocked install, retire, and recreate. Any undocumented assistance or
implementation inspection before a recorded failure makes the run fail.

## Maintenance health control plane

GitHub marketplaces include a weekly `marketplace-health` workflow. GitLab includes
the equivalent scheduled-pipeline job. The report covers skill review, semantic
freshness, dependencies, eval regressions, active owners, and compatibility. Run the
same six checks locally:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py health --marketplace ./acme-skills \
  --output MARKETPLACE_HEALTH.md --json-output marketplace-health.json
```

An overdue human-owned semantic definition is critical health evidence and blocks a
release until its owner reviews the meaning and updates the contract date or version.

### Migrating existing skills

Skills created before semantic contracts remain installable. Validation treats a
missing field as `{"applies": false}` and emits a migration warning. Before the next
release, add one of these to `discovery.json`:

```json
{"semantic_contract": {"applies": false}}
```

Use a complete contract instead when the answer depends on organizational definitions,
scope, grain, units, time interpretation, or source precedence. The domain owner—not
the agent or marketplace operator—approves that meaning.

## Environment, risk, and portfolio gates

Marketplace intake rejects skills unless `discovery.json` contains:

- documentation and data sources the skill must understand;
- required capabilities and blocking readiness checks;
- a risk tier, complete permission disclosure, and mutation boundary;
- an explicit semantic contract applicability decision for newly generated skills; and
- at least three queries that should trigger and three that should not trigger.

Installation is not readiness. `plan-install` includes the exact environment and risk
preflight that must pass in the consumer environment before useful execution.

Before release, run portfolio routing and coexistence checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py portfolio-check \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The check fails when a positive query routes to the wrong skill, a negative query
routes back to the prohibited skill, or the top two candidates tie. Release-mode
marketplace checks enforce the same gate.

## Guided organizational onboarding

Generate a department readiness report after marketplace initialization:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py onboarding-report \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The report blocks readiness until the marketplace has at least two departments,
named owners, an independent approver, a supported platform, and a starter bundle.
It then shows each department's owned and published skill counts and names the next
acceptance gate.
```

The report covers review staleness, dependency evidence, eval regressions, active
owners, and current-version compatibility certification. Critical findings make the
command fail so scheduled automation can alert maintainers.

## Outcome-based discovery

Add `discovery.json` to each skill. The required decision contract names the
`question`, observable `trigger` conditions, supported `decision` choices, required
`evidence`, and `success_measure`. Also include the outcome, intended users, input
and output types, use cases, examples, permissions/systems, completion time,
compatibility claims, and support tier (`supported`, `community`, or `deprecated`).
Intake rejects missing or empty decision fields and generates one structured page
under `skill-pages/`.

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py search "monthly revenue review" \
  --platform codex --support-tier supported --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Search ranks outcome matches first and returns only published skills. Platform
filters require current-version certification rather than an unverified claim.
Generic instruction words are ignored, weak one-token overlaps are not returned,
and substantial matches to a skill's `should_not_trigger` examples exclude it.

## Consented product measurement

Organizational metrics are off by default. Enable the closed, privacy-safe event
vocabulary with an expiring consent artifact:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py metrics-consent \
  --expires-at 2027-08-25T00:00:00Z --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The local ledger records only salted skill IDs, event type, UTC time, success,
optional duration, and an allowlisted platform. It stores no prompts, inputs,
outputs, paths, people, or organization identifiers. Record activation and use from
approved runtime automation, then inspect aggregates:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py metrics-record activation \
  --skill report-skill --platform codex --marketplace ./acme-skills
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py metrics-summary --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

## Distribution plans and compatibility certification

### Runtime capability resolution (design contract)

Managed installation remains the supported distribution path. For organizations that
need a policy-resolved runtime catalog, use the proposed
[Capability Resolver Contract](../references/capability-resolver-contract.md).
It preserves immutable release pins, compatibility certification, quarantine, and
auditability; it does not make an unreviewed "latest" skill silently executable.

Resolve the exact published and platform-certified artifacts visible in a local
schema-v2 marketplace without writing to it. Resolution is deny-by-default, so first
apply at least one allow policy:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "finance-codex-managed",
    "effect": "allow",
    "subjects": ["group:finance-analysts"],
    "agents": ["codex-cli"],
    "projects": ["github:acme/quarterly-close"],
    "environments": ["managed-macos"],
    "platforms": ["codex"],
    "skills": ["finance/report-skill"]
  }
]
```

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py policy.apply \
  --file ./resolver-policies.json --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Then resolve:

```bash
export SKILL_RESOLVER_ATTESTATION_SECRET='set-only-in-the-resolver-service'
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py skills.resolve \
  --attestation ./signed-execution-attestation.json \
  --skill finance/report-skill \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The signed attestation must include an issuer, marketplace audience, a maximum
five-minute validity window, nonce, identity claims, and a managed device ID. Its
HMAC-SHA-256 signature is verified using `SKILL_RESOLVER_ATTESTATION_SECRET`, which
belongs only in the resolver service or secret manager—not on user machines. The JSON
response includes the verified context, device ID, policy revision, marketplace commit,
exact skill version, relative artifact path, and deterministic SHA-256 directory hash.
Matching deny policies override allows.

Platform IDs are canonicalized across governance, planning, installation, search,
health, and certification. Use `github-copilot`; the legacy `copilot` input remains
accepted as an alias but stored evidence and generated plans always emit
`github-copilot`.

Generate a non-mutating plan before managed distribution. Remote plans require an
immutable tag matching the skill version or a full commit SHA:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py plan-install report-skill \
  --department finance --platforms codex,cursor,github-copilot \
  --scope user --release-ref v1.2.3 --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

Certification evidence names the platform, skill version, adapter and adapter
version, plus unique explicit checks whose `passed` values are true. Persist verified
evidence with:

```bash
python3 scripts/team_marketplace.py certify report-skill \
  --department finance --platform codex --evidence codex-evidence.json \
  --marketplace ./acme-skills
```

The adapters use `scripts/platforms.py` as the canonical platform registry. Native
and adapted artifact plans therefore stay aligned with the factory installers.
`check --release` blocks every declared platform that lacks passing certification
for the exact skill version. Updating a skill clears older certification evidence,
so certification must be repeated before the next release.
